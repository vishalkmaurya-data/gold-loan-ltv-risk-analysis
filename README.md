## Business problem

Management does not know how many active gold loans currently breach the 75% LTV cap, how much outstanding principal is exposed, or which schemes, states and branches are driving the problem. The risk team needs a reliable, reproducible assessment as of 15 October 2026 to plan margin calls before the next risk committee.

## Objectives

- Measure the fall in the gold rate from its 2026 peak to the assessment date.
- Recalculate the current LTV of every active gold loan using the latest gold rate.
- Quantify the number of loans and the outstanding principal above the 75% cap, and above 80% (critical).
- Identify the schemes, disbursal periods, states and branches that contribute most to breaches.
- Recommend a prioritised margin-call plan and any change needed to lending policy.
